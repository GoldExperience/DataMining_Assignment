great host!  Would definitely stay in Gary's place again!  A few tips in addition to what other reviewers wrote:  The \"Airlink 747 Express\" bus takes you from the airport to within 50 yards of Gary's apartment.  Cost is E6.00 one way, E10.00 round-trip if you buy the full ticket when you first get on.  The 747 bus uses different names for the bus stops than the city busses so you have to get off at the \"Christchurch Cathedral\" stop.  The bus ride takes 50 minutes each way.  Nobody met us at arrival but check-in was super easy using a lock box system.  Apartment was ready right on time and it was really convenient to use the bag drop so we could walk around town while we waited for check-in.  Apartment was very clean, comfortable, and recently renovated.  It's a walk-up with 8 flights of stairs (no elevator/lift).  For Americans unfamiliar with typical Euro-style apartments:  There is no electrical outlet in the bathroom, and the only other mirror is in the entrance hallway so the ladies had to sit on the floor in the hall to dry/style their hair.  The bedrooms are small (can't even walk around one of the double beds) but comfortable.  The washer/dryer is one of the compact style machines that uses the same drum for both washing and drying.  You can only do small loads and drying isn't very efficient so expect some additional line drying of damp clothes afterward.  There's only 1 US-style outlet adapter so bring extras, and don't forget a voltage converter if you need one.  Contrary to other reviews, there was no milk, OJ, tea, shampoo (only \"body wash\"), or detergent.  Location is unbeatable, right in the heart of Temple Bar!  Expect some street noise.  It's so perfectly located that it's literally walking distance to every major attraction (never needed a bus once), not to mention tons of night life and great restaurants & pubs.  Overall, it was an outstanding stay!  Looking forward to renting from Gary again next time we're in town (Website hidden by Airbnb)
